# 👨Flutter ‍Material About
This is an [Flutter](http://www.flutter.io) project. You, as a mobile developer, can use this library to show a material about screen in your apps. It was built to make your life easier when introducing you to your users, and also, to create an about screen pattern for material android apps. It's really simple and dynamic, check it out.

Highly inspired by this [Android Library](https://github.com/jrvansuita/MaterialAbout)
